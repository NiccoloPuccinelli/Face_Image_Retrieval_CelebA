# Facial Image Retrieval
In this project we performed a **content-based image retrieval**: Generation of an ordered list of images related to a query image. This model searches for the most similar face of a famous person with respect to a query face.

We trained the models on faces contained in [CelebA](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) dataset (~200000 images of ~10000 actors).

**More details** about the processing and architecture in `Slides_Image-Retrieval.pdf`. Dimostrative video and deployed model in the `DEMO` folder.
